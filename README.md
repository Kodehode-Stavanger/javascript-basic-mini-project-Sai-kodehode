# Mini project

## Welcome! This will be the last assignment for Javascript Basic!

The challenge is to make a mini project. You have full creative freedom, but your project should include DOM manipulation and some Javascript logic. Use my example projects as inspiration, but I don't want you to hand in a copy of either one:

- [Circle maker](https://github.com/Kodehode-Stavanger/circle-maker)
- [Unit converter](https://github.com/Kodehode-Stavanger/unit-converter)

**Remember to activate GitHub Pages for your project!**

*Good luck!*
